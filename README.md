# Project-Mapty

Hi! This short project was part of learning JavaScript object-oriented programming, geolocation, external libraries, localStorage etc. in the Udemy course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann. I wrote the codes by following Jonas' lectures and demos.

Mapty is a simple yet amazing application that enables the user to log their exercise (running or cycling) activities on a digital map like Google Maps. Enjoy seeing it at the link below! ðŸ˜€
